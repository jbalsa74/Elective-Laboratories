A short reflection paragraph (4–6 sentences) answering:
What design principle did you find most useful?
What part of Canva was easiest/hardest to use?
What did you learn about visual communication?



My Reflection

	The design principle I found most useful was balance, as it helped me understand how to arrange items so the layout didn't feel cluttered. In Canva, I found the "Elements" and "Graphics" tabs very easy to navigate when searching for visuals, and I loved using gradient colors to make my backgrounds stand out. However, the hardest part of the process was the "composition" phase specifically combining various elements, colors, and fonts to achieve a professional, aesthetic look. Through this process, I learned that visual communication is more than just picking pretty items; it’s about how every small choice works together to send a clear message. I now realize that even simple designs require a lot of intentional thought to make sure everything fits together perfectly.
